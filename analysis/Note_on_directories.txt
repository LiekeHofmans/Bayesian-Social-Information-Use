Note on directories

For data archiving, files and folders had to be reorganized. Therefore, organization as specified in the analyses script is different from where the files and folders are actually located. 
Please check and adapt the code accordingly. 

For example: previously, all the data and code pertaining to the online experiment (experiment 1), was located in the project root, under 0_online_experiment, with subfolders such as raw_data and analysis:
- root/0_online_experiment/raw_data
- root/0_online_experiment/analysis
Now, all raw_data is stored for both experiments together, same for analyses, etc.:
- root/raw_data/online_experiment
- root/analysis/01_preprocessing/online_experiment
- root/analysis/04_level-group/mushroom/online_experiment
